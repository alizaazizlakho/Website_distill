This helped identify the characteristics that increased the chance of survival and ones that did not. -Trained a Random Forest Classification on the train data to fit the model to make necessary predictions. Used .score() from sklearn to assess model performance with 85.85% accuracy of the model. # Home Price Predictions (Python): -Used data related to Houses such as ‘LotArea’, ‘YearBuilt’, ‘1st Floor SF’, ‘YrSold’ etcetera to determine a relationship between house features and the house price. Extracted, cleaned and interpreted data from the test dataset using python. -Used Random Forest Regressor from sklearn to make a predictive model having 97.37 accuracy and about 16702 of mean absolute error for the house price where the house prices ranged from 34900 to 755000.\nR projects:\nTableau porjects:\n\n\n\n",
